 * @brief A helper class for the AccelStepperI2C and related libraries.
 *
 * I split
 * it from an earlier version of the AccelStepperI2C library when adding Servo
 * support, to be able to have a clean separation librarywise between the two:
 * The wrapper represents the I2C slave and handles all communication with it.
 * AccelStepperI2C, ServoI2C, and others use it for communicating with the slave. To do
 * so, an I2Cwrapper object is instantiated with the slave's I2C address and
 * then passed to its client object's (AccelStepperI2C etc.) constructor.
 * @par Command codes
 * * 000 - 009 (reserved)
 * * 010 - 059 AccelStepperI2C
 * * 060 - 069 ServoI2C
 * * 070 - 079 PinI2C
 * * 080 - 239 (unused)
 * * 240 - 255 I2Cwrapper commands (reset slave, change address etc.)
 * @par
 * New classes could use I2Cwrapper to easily add even more capabilities
 * to the slave, e.g. for driving DC motors, granted that the firmware is extended
 * accordingly and the above list of uint8_t command codes is kept free from duplicates.
